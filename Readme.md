# Python Challenge Homework

## Background

In this homework assignment we created Python scripts to complete two seperate chalenges **PyBank** and **PyPoll**. For **PyBank** we used Pyhton 3.9 to analyze the financial records of a company. For **PyPoll** we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. 

## PyBank

In this challenge, our Python script analyzes company records to calculate the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

In this challenge, our Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

  ## Conclusion

For our final script, the results of our analysis wil both print to the terminal and export a text file with our results in the Analysis folders.
